Question 1

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

Column  Type
A       INT
B       INT
C       INT


Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input

A   B   C
20  20  23 
20  20  20
20  21  22
13  14  30

Sample Output

Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle

Notes:
Values 20 20 20 is an equilateral triangle
Values 20 20 30 is an isosceles triangle and the combined value of the 2 smallest sides is bigger than the largest side
Values 20 21 22 is an scalene triangle
Values 2 5 10 is not a triangle
